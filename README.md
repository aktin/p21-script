# p21-script [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=aktin_p21-script&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=aktin_p21-script) ![Python 3.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue)

A Python script to import inpatient treatment data according to ยง21 KHEntgG into the AKTIN DWH

The script is intended to import csv files with inpatient treatment data according to ยง21 KHEntG into the local i2b2 database of the AKTIN DWH. All data is uploaded into the [`observation_fact`](https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/ServerSideDesign/OBSERVATION_FACT+Table) table of i2b2. Following requirements must be met by the csv files:
* all csv files must be uploaded together as a zip archive
* all files must be encoded in UTF-8
* the semicolon is used as a separator for data fields
* the comma is used as a separator for decimals

The import process is divided into two steps: A verification of the files to be uploaded and the file upload itself. The script can only be executed with one process at a time. On the AKTIN DWH, the import process looks like following:

An import is currently only possible of the four files `fall.csv`, `fab.csv`, `icd.csv` and `ops.csv`. The zip archive must contain at least the file `fall.csv`. The other csv files are optional. All other files will be ignored by the import script.

Only valid encounter of a csv file are imported, i.e. the necessary fields of an encounter are complete and correspond to the formatting specifications set by the [InEK GmbH](https://www.g-drg.de/Datenlieferung_gem._21_KHEntgG). A distinction is made between mandatory and optional fields. An invalid mandatory field leads to the exclusion of the whole encounter. An invalid optional field will be ignored during the import.

As the inpatient treatment data is only an extension of the routine documentation of the emergency departments stored in the AKTIN DWH, all valid encounters from the p21 data must be matched with existing encounters from the routine documentation. Matching with existing encounters is done using the field `KH-internes-Kennzeichen` of the csv files and the field `billing id` of the imported CDA documents.

## Usage

The script is only suitable for usage on the AKTIN DWH V1.4 or higher. For the installation of the script on the AKTIN DWH, following steps are necessary:
* Put the script on the server of your AKTIN DWH into the folder `/var/lib/aktin/import-script/`
* Change the owner of the script to be `wildfly:wildfly`
* Restart your AKTIN DWH
* The script should appear in the view of the AKTIN DWH in the tab `Daten-Import`.
* Select the script and import your data

### Local Usage

It is also possible to run the script manually. For this, the respective import process (`verify_file` or `import_file`) and the path to the zip file to be uploaded must be passed to the script as input arguments:

`python p21import.py {import process} {path to the zip file}`

When executing the script via the AKTIN DWH, some information is transmitted as environment variables. For local execution the following variables must be set accordingly:

| Parameter  | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| SCRIPT_ID | ID of p21import.py (see @ID=****) | p21 |
| SCRIPT_VERSION | Version of p21import.py (see @VERSION=****) | 1.5 |
| ZIP_UUID | UUID of the uploaded zip file on the AKTIN DWH | e296bf5c-46b3-11ec-81d3-0242ac130003 |
| USERNAME | User of the i2b2 database | username |
| PASSWORD | Password of the database user | password |
| I2B2_CONNECTION_URL | Connection url to the i2b2 database | jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/i2b2 |
| PATH_AKTIN_PROPERTIES | Path to the aktin.properties | /etc/aktin/aktin.properties |


## Testing

For testing the script, the folder `test/` is attached. The subfolders perform the following functions :

* `integration/` : All tests that require a database connection. Currently Unfinished.
* `local/` : Script with dummy configuration to run `p21import.py` locally
* `resources/` : Test data used by all tests
* `unit/` : Unit tests for `p21import.py`
